### Problem

You, or someone else, has just made changes dns settings pointing to a website and you can't browse to that site because your browser has cached details pointing to the old settings. Or, more likely, you're trying to use some dodgy web app that's messed up because of bad session cookies. To deal with this, you typically need to clear the browser cache.
